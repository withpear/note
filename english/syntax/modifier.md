1. Misplaced modifiers
place a modifier too far away from the thing it describes

                                                                       ------   adverb slowly is modifying sang

"The way he sings annoys me so often."
                            --------           'So often' modifies 'annoys'   

3. donâ€™t clearly state the noun that is supposed to be modified by the modifying phrase, especially common with participle phrases
