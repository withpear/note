Put Your Head on My Shoulders

2
00:00:32,653 --> 00:00:36,282
Four score and 1145 years ago...

3
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:40,287
our forefathers' foreheads
conceived a new nation.

4
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:45,693
This Presidents' Day, we honor the
values my body fought and died for.

5
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:48,731
ROBOT:
Values like this new Plymouth V'ger.

6
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:50,765
I'm Malfunctioning Eddie...

7
00:00:51,013 --> 00:00:55,529
and I'm malfunctioning so badly,
I'm giving these cars away!

8
00:00:55,813 --> 00:01:00,887
Let's go car shopping! My parents said
if I got B's, they'd buy me a bar.

9
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:02,452
I got all C's!

10
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:06,089
Mind if I tag along?
My ass needs servicing.

11
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,803
This says it could catch fire
in a collision.

12
00:01:10,093 --> 00:01:12,766
No wonder you're
at the end of conga lines.

13
00:01:13,053 --> 00:01:15,931
I'll get my coat. Let's go, Bender.

14
00:01:21,173 --> 00:01:26,372
I'm Victor, and I know many things
about the art of unloading fine cars...

15
00:01:26,573 --> 00:01:28,211
on beautiful women.

16
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:31,611
Now tell us she's witty
and sophisticated.

17
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:36,049
A gentleman always
sells a lady a car first.

18
00:01:36,293 --> 00:01:40,252
This is a Beta Romeo.
Yes, the Beta Romeo.

19
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:45,687
Note the cross-your-heart seat belt.
It protects, lifts and separates.

20
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:53,288
Spotted her when you walked in, huh?
She's a beauty.

21
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:55,251
Yeah, beautiful coffee.

22
00:01:55,453 --> 00:01:58,013
No, the Ford Thunder
Cougar Falcon Bird!

23
00:01:58,413 --> 00:02:01,644
Nothing makes you feel
more like a man.

24
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:05,243
- How much do you want to spend?
- I'm not buying.

25
00:02:05,453 --> 00:02:09,651
I see you don't care if people
question your sexual orientation.

26
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:12,845
I do, but I don't know how
to make them stop!

27

The seats are stuffed
with eagle down...

29
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:22,290
the dash inlaid
with beaks of eagles.

30
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:25,650
There are eagles
under the floorboards.

31
00:02:25,893 --> 00:02:30,728
- That's an awful lot of eagle.
- Yes. And yet...

32
00:02:31,173 --> 00:02:35,530
- What's wrong?
- The luxury edition has more eagle.

33
00:02:35,773 --> 00:02:40,164
- It's sad to think you're missing out.
- Oh, don't be sad.

34
00:02:40,413 --> 00:02:43,928
My parents are paying
and they're incredibly rich.

35
00:02:48,173 --> 00:02:50,129
Ow! Ow! Ow!

36
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:58,850
I installed bumpers to reduce
the risk of butt failure.

37
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:03,043
You, sir, have defaced
a national treasure!

38
00:03:03,253 --> 00:03:07,326
I demand you restore my buttocks
to their former glory!

39
00:03:07,613 --> 00:03:12,482
All right, but that ass is gonna blow,
and when it does...

40
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:16,521
I pray you're not mooning
someone you care about.

41
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:21,170
This car has everything
a beautiful woman like me needs.

42
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:22,647
Victor said so.

43
00:03:23,813 --> 00:03:26,691
No dog food for Victor tonight!

44
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:31,643
The sticker says $55,000.
But we'll only go as high as, say...

45
00:03:31,893 --> 00:03:33,690
Sixty thousand!

46
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:37,362
I'll have to ask my manager.

47
00:03:37,653 --> 00:03:42,773
- You don't go above the sticker price.
- I thought it was an auction.

48
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:49,731
- He is not too happy.
- I'm sorry. Eighty thousand?

49
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:59,003
I'm terrible at parallel parking.

50
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:05,772
HERMES: You're asking for a day off?
Get out of my sight!

51
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:08,368
You're bogarting my patience.

52
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:10,451
Who were you yelling at?

53
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:15,847
I asked me for Valentine's Day off.
I was in no mood for my shenanigans.

54
00:04:16,053 --> 00:04:20,444
Valentine's Day's coming?
I forgot to get a girlfriend again.

55
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:25,448
- Since we have no dates, we should...
- You assume I can't get a date?

56
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,612
How about 8:00?

57
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:31,363
I'm taking my new car to Mercury.
Wanna come?

58
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:35,891
- Okay. How's the weather?
- The usual. Boiling lead, lava.

59
00:04:36,173 --> 00:04:37,652
So, what? Shorts?

60
00:04:47,493 --> 00:04:52,328
Boy, this a/c is incredible.
I better turn on the heater too.

61
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:05,450
This heater is incredible!
I better turn up the a/c some more.

62
00:05:06,413 --> 00:05:09,769
- How about some icy margaritas?
- Yeah!

63
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:19,892
- We're slowing down!
- I'll hit the fuel guzzler!

64
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:24,643
Who wants Pop-Tarts?

65
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:40,646
It's okay. I have an emergency phone.

66
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:48,124
- What are you doing?
- It's a videophone.

67
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:53,687
I'm in the Astro-Afro-
Antarctico-Amerasian-Auto Association.

68
00:05:53,893 --> 00:05:55,167
Hello? Septuple A?

69
00:06:03,053 --> 00:06:05,044
It'll be a couple hours.

70
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:08,484
Oh, I'm gonna get sweat
on my sweat suit.

71
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:13,924
You're rich. How come you dress
like you're doing your laundry?

72
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:17,888
My parents tell me
to be more ladylike. As though.

73
00:06:18,173 --> 00:06:22,963
My folks were always on me to wear
underpants. What am l, the pope?

74
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:27,246
If you were, they'd be all,
"Straighten your pope hat"...

75
00:06:27,493 --> 00:06:30,246
and "Put on your good vestments."

76
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:36,684
It's nice to find someone
I can talk to about stuff, and junk.

77
00:06:36,973 --> 00:06:42,172
It's like we feel the same way
about junk and stuff, or whatever.

78

Whoa-ho!

79
00:06:57,573 --> 00:06:58,573
Oh.

- While they tow us, you wanna do it?
- Yeah!

TOW TRUCK DRIVER:
Whoa-ha-ha-ho!

00:07:11,893 --> 00:07:15,249
Which concludes the summary
of the movie I saw.

- No.

85

- Anyone sleep together?
- No.

86
00:07:21,893 --> 00:07:23,326
- Yep.
- Kind of.

87
00:07:24,293 --> 00:07:26,807
- What?
- Oh, my God!

88
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:32,292
- One thing led to another.
- It led there again when we got home.

89
00:07:35,853 --> 00:07:38,572
You snagged the perfect girlfriend.

90
00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:42,283
Amy's rich, she's probably
got other characteristics...

91
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:44,808
Bender, romance isn't about money.

92
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:50,042
It's coincidence that Zoidberg is
desperately poor and miserably lonely?

93
00:07:50,253 --> 00:07:51,253
Please!

94
00:07:51,453 --> 00:07:55,651

it's because he's hideous.

- What? No!

00:08:02,693 --> 00:08:04,843
Really? Oh, dear.

98
00:08:05,813 --> 00:08:10,841
You're both very lucky. I'd pay
to end my miserable loneliness.

99

If I weren't so desperately poor.

100
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,805

for romance?

I have a scheme
so deviously clever that l...

102

- Stupid anti-pimping laws.

Well, pay the man!

- Honey, we love you!
- Shut up, baby, I know it!

105

Computer dating. Like pimping,
but you rarely say "upside your head."

106
00:08:40,373 --> 00:08:46,005
- Why would anyone ask you for help?
- Don't make me go upside your head!

I need a stapler!

with his fearsome gonad.

- I don't know.

- Smith. Zapp Smith. Brannigan.

We can picnic and spit at Jupiter.

Yeah. You know, Fry,
I like hanging out with you.

It was great. But now
she's talking about hanging out.

She's getting way too serious.
I'm not a one-woman man, Leela.

Sure. What do you want
to do for Valentine's Day?

- There.

Looks like we'll be spending
a lot more time together, Fry.

This always happens
with office romances.

in your life.

- Fry?
- Sorry. I guess I control that arm.

What'd you want to talk about, anyway?

Maybe we'd better talk in private.
I'll meet you in the closet.

I like you as a friend. But we're
spending too much time together.

- You're breaking up with me?
- We should see other people.

00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:43,042
I was really having fun.
If that's how you feel.

I'm sorry, but it is.

If we're not seeing each other, can I
get another date for Valentine's Day?

- Unless it would make you feel bad.
- Hey, I can get a date too.

I can attract all sorts of women.

00:13:58,853 --> 00:14:02,846
With my body, I think
you'll only attract one sort of woman.

Oh?
Oh.

Are you familiar
with my friend Al Gore?

Losers get really desperate
around Valentine's Day.

Yeah, it's pathetic, all right.

- No!
- Six hundred.

to you for a minute in private?

No problem.

something to happen with the date?

Really? I heard that banking

product of five regulatory traditions.
